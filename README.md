# NYC Citi Bike Analysis 

## Project Overview

Data from Citi Bike ride share service in New York City, New York was analysed in an attempt to evaluate whether or not ride share services in Des Moines, Iowa would be a worthwhile investment.

## Software

* Tableau v 2020.2.2
* VS Code v 1.46.1

## Method

Data from a csv file on New York ride share was utilised to analyse feautures of the service there. Data was gathered on Des Moines to compare the two cities and evaluate the likelihood of success for a ride share service. Data was processed and visualitions were created using Tableau. For Average Trip Duration, it was assumed that the data from persons "born before 1915", as well as the huge spike in data for persons "born in 1969" were inexplicably innacurate and thus those birth years were excluded.

## Analysis

New York Citi Bike data has proven to be an invaluable source of information for bike share services. From it, we can see the large service area covered centers around a busy bustling area, oft frequented by tourists. This helps inform us that a busy city like Des Moines may also be successful over a quieter small town in Iowa. 

The average trip duration and peak usage hours inform us that trips average under 30 minutes and most frequently occur around rush hour, suggesting a significant number of rides recorded were of individuals on their commute. Additionally, the data that shows most rides were procured by customers with a subscription to the ride share service (81%) further supports this idea. 

Iowa is a bike-friendly culture, home to the largest annual bike tour in the world([RAGBRAI](https://ragbrai.com/)), Des Moines has a wealth of [bike-ready lanes, trails and paths](https://iowadot.gov/iowabikes/bikemap/home.aspx) and the city continues further roadway construction to improve [accessibility for cyclists](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/business/development/2020/05/06/ingersoll-avenue-des-moines-remake-elevated-bike-lanes/3078236001/).

Des Moines and New York City share certain [demographic similarities](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/newyorkcitynewyork,desmoinescityiowa/PST045219), such as with respect to age and gender, while also enjoying a far [lower unemployment rate](https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm), with Iowa only seeing 8% unemployment versus New York's 15.7%. There is significant reason to believe that bike share services will be successful in [Des Moines](https://desmoines.bcycle.com/), with many persons using bike share as a regular commute as in New York city.
